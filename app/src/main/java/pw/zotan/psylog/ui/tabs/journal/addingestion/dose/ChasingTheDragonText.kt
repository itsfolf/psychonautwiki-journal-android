            This is likely the least clinically delivered route of administration. An overdose caused by chasing the dragon is hard to predict because this technique doesn't deliver a standardized dosage. It's virtually impossible even for skilled users to know how much of the substance that has been evaporated, burned, and inhaled.
            These combined factors may create a false sense of security when a given dose seems safe to repeat, but may cause an overdose when all the factors are randomly excluded.
